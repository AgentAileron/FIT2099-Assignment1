This file contains links to all external platforms used, all of which have their own methods of tracking contributions and revisions. (for lucidchart, contributions may be tracked via the icon on the right sidebar).

This file is not provided due to any work dispute within the group, but because this git repository was not used to track assignment 1 progress and its commit history does not reflect member contributions adequately.
